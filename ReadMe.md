#Introduction
webBasedTesting project is a Selenium Maven project with JUnit test cases for automated testing. The project focuses on testing various scenarios on a website using Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, and Maven.

#Getting Started
To run the test cases, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Maven and Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
Configure the project's dependencies using Maven.
Update the test case files in the src/test/java directory with your own test implementations.
Run the test cases using JUnit in your IDE or through the Maven command line.


#Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies:

Selenium WebDriver version 4.10.0: to interact with the web browser and perform actions on web elements.
JUnit version 4.13.2: for writing and executing test cases.
Maven: for managing project dependencies and building the project.
Apache POI 5.2.3 for Java libraries for reading and writing files in Microsoft Office formats, such as Word, PowerPoint and
 Excel. - Download and add dependency


Sure! Here's an example of how a README file could be written to provide instructions for running Selenium tests on Jenkins for a Maven project:

#Running Selenium Tests on Jenkins for Maven Project
Below information provides instructions on how to set up and run Selenium tests for a Maven project on Jenkins. Follow the steps below to configure Jenkins and execute the Selenium tests.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

Jenkins server up and running
A Maven project with Selenium tests
Chrome installed on the Jenkins server
Jenkins Configuration Steps
Log in to Jenkins and create a new Jenkins job.
Configure the Git repository URL in the job configuration to fetch your Maven project source code.
Add a build step of type "Invoke top-level Maven targets".
In the "Goals" field, enter the Maven goals needed to build and run your tests. For example, use clean test to build and execute the tests.
Configure any additional build steps required for your project (e.g., setting up environment variables, downloading dependencies).
Set up the build triggers (e.g., periodic, SCM changes) as needed.
Save the job configuration.

Selenium Test Execution
Once the Jenkins job is configured, follow these steps to execute the Selenium tests:

Trigger the Jenkins job manually or wait for the configured build trigger.
Jenkins will fetch the latest source code from the Git repository and start the build process.
During the build, Maven will compile the code, download dependencies, and execute the tests.
Jenkins will display the build status and console output in real-time.
Once the build is complete, Jenkins will provide test result reports, including the number of tests executed and any failures or errors.
Viewing Test Results
To view the test results and reports:

Open the Jenkins job page after the build is complete.
Look for links or tabs related to test results or reports.
Click on the links or tabs to access detailed test reports, including test names, status, durations, and any failures or errors encountered.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the build or test execution, refer to the console output and error messages displayed in the Jenkins job. This information can help identify the problem and guide you in resolving it.

If you require further assistance, reach out to your Jenkins administrator or consult the Jenkins community resources.

That's it! You now have a README file that provides step-by-step instructions on running Selenium tests on Jenkins for your Maven project.
Feel free to customize and enhance the README with additional project-specific details as needed.
